# Project Overview

This project focuses on developing wide and deep learning models to predict salary data.\
The main goals are to create robust machine learning models using Keras and TensorFlow and to evaluate their performance and computational efficiency.

# Data Description

The dataset includes various features such as job title, location, experience level, and company size. The target variable is salary.\

# Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values\
Encode categorical variables\
Scale numerical features\
Split the dataset into training and testing sets\
Model Development\

## Three neural network models were developed:

Basic Model: A simple MLP with two hidden layers.\
Deeper Model: An MLP with additional hidden layers.\
Wider Model: An MLP with wider hidden layers.\
